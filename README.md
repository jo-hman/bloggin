Hey! This project is still work in progress.
Read and see what has been done and what I plan on adding.

This project was created with a purpose of learning microservices.

It is a Java 17 and Spring Boot microservice RESTful API for a blogging website for which frontend is also planned for purpose of learning. When creating this project I tried to use most useful and real life technologies available.
Such as:
- Spring Data JPA
- Spring Cloud
- Zipkin (for distributed tracing)
- Eureka Service Discovery
- RabbitMQ (for asynchronous communication beetwen certain services)
- Maven
- Docker
- PostgreSQL database
- lombok (to get rid of boilerplate code)

I plan on:
- adding some security with JWT using Spring Security
- adding more real life logic to services
- learning unit testing and integration testing
- learning Kubernetes
